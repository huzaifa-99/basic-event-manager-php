# Project Installation
 * Download the project and unzip. 
 * Next, the `code` folder must be placed into the `htdocs` folder.
 * Database (in `database` folder) must be imported into MySQL for the code to function properly, Database username and password are the default ones for Xampp.
 * To run the project, type `localhost[:PORT_NO]/path to (code/index.php)`. The process after that is already explained above.

# More Info
The project was created 11 months before today(9/9/2020) on PHP-7.0 version.

The main aim of this project was for me to understand ***PHP-Mailer*** and ***AJAX*** in a web application. This was my semester project on web-development course.
